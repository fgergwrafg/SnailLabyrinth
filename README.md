# Snail Labyrinth Challenge

For everyone who learns programming or just watns to be in shape.

## Introduction
I've been inspired by a video of robotic contest  
[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Jjuc5SBl25w/default.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Jjuc5SBl25w)
There are many other videos and projects like that, tha main idea is that, there is labyrinh for roboic car drawn on flad surface (2d labyrinth), supposing that robot can follow only lines using own ligth sensors that sense only small porion of surface under robot (therefore robot can't see whole labyrhinth at once)
